It's day two here in Rome. Francesco joined the News Labs party in the middle of the night, and the events are finally kicking off - after a couple of espressos and a good night of sleep.

Yesterday, we set up this space as a place to drop and aggregate publicly what we'll be working on these next two weeks.

#### Here's our plan for today:

* Put up a small list of recommended datasets and sources (mostly institutional)
* Publish some topic-modelling work from Sylvia
* Continue to update the [reading list](http://19mm.bbcnewslabs.co.uk/resources/reading-list/)
