Yesterday, we gave our News Labs Road Show to the participants of the 19 Million Project and shared the [project ideas](http://19mm.bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2015/11/05/day-4-list-of-projects.html) we've brought with us an developed over the last couple of days.

Following the Q&A and response from the team, we decided to go ahead with two projects initially:

### Refugee Information Portal

Sylvia teamed up with a group of designers and activists to build a portal, which will aggregate on-arrival information for refugees - answering question like: Where do I register? Where can I find housing? Is it legal and work and how can I access the health care system? She's dragging another developer into the boat and hopes to provide the most simple information system. The audience: Refugees.

### 'Go-the-journey' - a mobile game

Basile and Francesco found their ideal partner: [Mike from MIT Media Labs](https://twitter.com/lazerwalker), a game developer. They want to build an interactive story of a fictional refugees traversing countries and making decisions. This way, we hope we can provide another access to the journey refugees are making. The audience: Our audience.
