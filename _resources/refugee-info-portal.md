> **First steps in a new country - a refugee's guide book.**



Try to put yourself in the shoes of a refugee for a second.

**Imagine you just got out of a train in Munich, Germany, what do you do?**

Take your own country, assume no prior knowledge and search information about the most basic  logistic steps upon your arrival. Try.

We tried it in Italy, Germany and France and ended up on official government websites, explaining the asylum and immigration process in great formality - but its hard to find answers to the most obvious questions.

If you ever built up a new life in a different country, you know that some of these logistics aren't plainly obvious - now imagine that you don't even speak the language and didn't have your "Erasmus advisor" to prepare you for the change.


- Where do I register and what do I need for registration? A form, a photo, a passport?
- What are my options for housing?
- Is there I can work and earn money?
- What are the steps of the immigration process, how long will it take?
- What can I do with my children, can they attend child-care, kindergarten, school?
- Where can I learn the language?
- How does the medical system work in this country?

Certainly the questions most refugees have a similar and we can help them answer them. We propose to aggregate a page with per-country-information on immigration procedure, contact addresses, housing, work.

We propose to collect this information, from official (government pages) in each country and provide it in a simple, concise format in several languages. While [Refugee Info](http://refugeeinfo.eu/lesbos) provides help during the journey to Europe, we want to provide help in the next step: Once you arrived where you wanted to be, what now?

**Desired product**: A simple website, in several relevant languages, which provides basic logistic information for newly arrived refugees in each European country. This page should be able to evolve and expand beyond the event - so let's do that properly!

**Who we need to make it**: This is not so much a data-project, but mainly a manual aggregation effort. We need people, who are willing to aggregate this information from the web, maybe calling up civil services or administration. If you're Italian, you're probably most efficient to do that for Italy - and given that we are an international bunch, we should be able to collect this info from most countries with ease. Immigration experts can help us ask and answer the right questions, data scientists unify the information across countries, web developers and designers set up the page itself.
